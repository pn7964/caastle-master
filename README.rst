CaaStle
=========

CaaStle is a **full-stack microservices deployment tool** for Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and Amazon ECS.

Platform of containerized applications/microservices includes application/web servers, container orchestration engine clusters, and applicationâ€™s external resource dependencies such as managed database servers.

Key elements of CaaStle

- **Application-centric abstractions**:

  *Environment* is the top level abstraction. It defines container orchestration engine cluster and managed cloud services needed by the application.
  *Application* is composed of one or more application containers and is deployed in the environment.
  You get a shell customized for the environment with ability to directly use cloud-native CLIs against the platform elements created in that environment.

- **Declarative platform definition**:

  *environment yaml* file is used to define managed cloud resources within an environment; *application yaml* is used to define application
  container (for single container applications);
  *pod/deployment yaml or ecs's task yaml* is supported for multi-container applications.
  No need for platform inputs using command line parameters.

- **Platform element association**:

  Integrated creation and binding of cloud resources with application containers provides view of the entire application run-time environment with
  appropriate platform elements associations.

- **Environment change history**:

  History of operations that change the state of an environment is maintained for traceability and repeatability.

- **Non-hosted implementation**:

  CaaStle is a non-hosted implementation. There is no centralized server like PaaS implementations. CaaStle can be installed anywhere alongside Docker.
  This architecture enables effective local development with Docker environments setup on the individual workstations or laptops.
  The non-hosted nature also simplifies integration of CaaStle with any DevOps workflow.
